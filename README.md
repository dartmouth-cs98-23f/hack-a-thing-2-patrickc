# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

Our group had multiple things which we planned on completing, in this I have created a chrome extension in the event that we use this feature in our main project. I opted for this over ML since I have taken a few ML courses so I thought this would be a better plan. My project followed the youtube guide, cited at the bottom.

## Who Did What?

This was a solo project.

## What you learned

I learned how to create a chrome extension which I have never done before. I also tried out the google api's and tried to get familiar with them.
